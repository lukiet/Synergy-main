                <h2 class="heading"> About Us</h2>
                <p>On May 30, 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, a group of friends came together to do their
                    little bit for the community that was struggling to survive. The coming together of these friends
                    gave birth to Synergy. Synergy is a community based charitable organization that focuses on
                    empowering young school-going boys and girls. What started as a menstrual hygiene support program
                    for teenage school-going girls has over the years transformed into a community empowerment
                    organization that not only supports, on a regular basis, vulnerable families with hygiene items
                    (toiletries and sanitary towels), but also sponsors children to school.

                <p>.As Synergy, we provide girls in our program with sanitary towels and toiletries. We provide school
                    items including uniforms and stationery to both boys and girls, and support their families on a
                    quarterly basis with food items.Our resource mobilization model is based on monthly contributions
                    from members of the organization
                    and biannual funds drive. Through the monthly contribution and the fund drives, we are able to
                    sustain our programs and support children from vulnerable families from within Juja.

                    <h2>Team Building</h2>
                    <p>Our recent team-building event at Synergy was a powerful experience that brought us closer
                        together as a group. We immersed ourselves in activities designed to strengthen our
                        communication, trust, and collaboration, all while having fun and learning more about one
                        another. Each challenge highlighted our collective strengths and showed us how much more we can
                        achieve when we work as one. By the end of the day, we felt a renewed sense of unity and
                        purpose, ready to continue our mission of making a positive impact in the community with even
                        greater synergy.</p>

                    <h2>Quarterly food distribution</h2>
                    <p>This quarter, Synergy came together once again for our regular food distribution event, and it
                        was an incredibly fulfilling experience. As a group, we worked diligently to organize, pack, and
                        distribute essential food items to those in need within our community. The teamwork and
                        dedication of every member were evident as we ensured that everything ran smoothly and
                        efficiently. Each interaction with the individuals and families we served reminded us of the
                        importance of our mission. By the end of the day, we were filled with a deep sense of purpose,
                        knowing that our collective efforts had made a real difference in the lives of many.</p>
